    <h1>Chief Keef</h1>

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>Chief Keef started the drill subgenre movement in hiphop when he was only 16 years old. After his success in his
      hit record "Love Sosa", a new wave of drill was birthed into hiphop, where rappers who were involved in the
      streets would rap about their activity in the streets over an aggressive monotone beat</p>

    <p>Chief Keef is a father figure in hiphop, as he has made a lot of careers off his sound. His only downfall was not
      letting go of the streets, where he came form and focusing on his music which was very influential at the time. It
      was confirmed Apple had their eyes on Chief Keef for a while and wanted to sign him to an exclusive apple deal for
      millions of dollars but later shelfed that idea when it was clear Chief Keef was not focused on music, but rather
      gang banging. The deal was later given to #1 hip hop artist in the world, Drake.</p>
