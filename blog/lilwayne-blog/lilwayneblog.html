    <h1>Lil Wayne</h1>

    <h2>Career</h2>

    <p>
      One of the most skilled and influential rappers of our time, Wayne has been in the spotlight since he was 14 years
      old and since then has been running laps through hiphop culture with his clever metaphors and insane wordplay. Lil
      Wayne has cemented himself a mogul in hiphop, having influenced a whole generation of rappers, much like Chief
      Keef.

    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from his influence, Lil Wayne has also birthed many careers of rappers who are relevant and influential
      themselves. He's signed notable rappers like Drake, and Nicki Minaj to his label "Young Money". Drake and Nicki
      Minaj are two prolific figures in hiphop today, currently on a 15+ year run, with the help of Wayne.
